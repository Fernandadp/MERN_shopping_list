 -In package.json :
 "scripts": nodemon is created to be able to see changes without having to restart the 
 server everytime I make a server side change.
 -In server.js: 
  + express is the backend framework.
  + mongoose is the orm to interact with de DB.
  + bodyParser gets and pushes requests
- Initialize express into a variable called App.
- Create a DB on mLAb and then bring it into the werver.js file.
- Connect to Mongo using Mongoose (mongoose.connect(db)). This is promise based, 
so we use .then to send a message once the db is connected.
- If there is an erro, .catch will send a message.
- const port = variable for the port (Heroku process.env.PORT) or port 5000.
